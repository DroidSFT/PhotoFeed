# Photo Feed Android app.

This app shows photos from the Flickr service.
The user can search photos by keywords or simply view recently uploaded images.
The last loaded list of photos is stored in the cache database.
Pull-to-refresh gesture updates the list of photos.
Click on a photo item opens the corresponding web page.

Besides the Google Support libraries, the app also uses:
- Retrofit;
- GSON;
- Otto event bus;
- Picasso;
- Android Priority Job Queue;
- DBFlow ORM.
